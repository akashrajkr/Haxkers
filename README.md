# Problem statement

Build a solution to synchronize a system for patients to book appointments from a doctor. It should display timings of when the doctor is free and allow patients to choose their time slot of appointment based on the same. Develop this application with required front end such that it is easy to use and also accounts for all test cases (e.g. If two patients book the same slot).
